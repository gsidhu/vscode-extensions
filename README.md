# VSCode Extensions

This is a repository of repositories. It contains a list of VSCode extensions that I have created or modified for my personal use.

## Extensions
1. [Open in Browser](./open-in-browser/): Opens the current Git repo's remote URL in the browser. A surprisingly absent feature in VSCode.
