# VSCode Extensions

This is a repository of repositories. It contains a list of VSCode extensions that I have created or modified for my personal use.

## Extensions
1. [Open in Browser](https://github.com/gsidhu/open-in-browser): Opens the current Git repo's remote URL in the browser. A surprisingly absent feature in VSCode.

## License
All extensions are licensed under the GNU GPL-3 License, unless otherwise stated. See the LICENSE file in each extension's repository for more details.
